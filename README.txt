A Bot That runs the Danisen tournament format commonly used in games like Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike

Danisen is a ranking battle/tournament format that’s used in arcades that persists for as long as the interest holds up for it pretty much. Game Versus’ Danisen ended up going on for several years after SF4 came out, and is largely credited with keeping the Third Strike scene alive in Tokyo and Japan as a whole.

How Danisen works is that everyone has assigned Dans (ranks) and points within that rank (usually ranging from -3 to +3). The first week, everyone locks in with 1 character, and starts out at a point value of zero in Dan 1. Everyone in Dan 1 is put into a basic ft1 cab rotation, with a win adding 1 to your point value, with a loss subtracting 1 from your point value while also kicking you off the cab for the next person (you can’t go lower than -3 in Dan 1). If you happen to reach +3, you get promoted to the next Dan with a point value of 0 (if you reach +3 in Dan 1 for example you get promoted to +0 in Dan 2). However, if you happen to reach -3 in any Dan (with the exception of Dan 1), you end up getting demoted to a point value of 0 in the previous Dan (reaching -3 in Dan 2 puts you at 0 in Dan 1). 
However, let’s say you’re playing your Ken that’s really good. You’re so good at that one character that your ken reaches a Dan that no one else is in, and it’s probably going to be a while before someone else’s main ends up reaching the same Dan as your Ken. You can make a new entry into the danisen as one of your secondaries (let’s say your solid, but not as good ryu), and you will be starting fresh at a point value of 0 at Dan 1.
